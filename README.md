# MARS Project

https://mars.poolin.fi. 

Mars Project combined standardized Bitcoin hashrate product and liquidity mining together,  packing POW mining into an on-chain protocol.
It provides a consistent Bitcoin mining output which could be acutely calculated in the very beginning, offering an edge for users on mining stability. 
No more complicated variables on daily mining. On the other hand, MARS token would be distributed to users in this project. 
Daily liquidity providing (LP) reward, shortened the distance of DeFi to Bitcoin community.

The protocol consists of pBTC35A tokens and MARS token. Each pBTC35A token represents 1TH/s hashrate with pre-determined power ratio, mining rigs would be in Poolin Superhashrateâ€™s custody during life cycle. 
While net profit on wBTC would be distributed per block. In the first batch, Poolin Superhashrate would provide 50,000 pBTC35A (approximately 50PH/s) tokens for Bitcoin (output with wBTC) mining in this protocol and lock up more than 50PH/s machines phisically. 
Two ways to obtain pBTC35A tokens, inhouse store or Uniswap. ETH and other POW mining tokens coming soon but no firm schedule yet.
